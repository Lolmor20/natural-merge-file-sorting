# natural-merge-file-sorting

This project was created as an assignment for Database Structures course at my university.
It's goal was to write a program for sorting file's contents using natural merge sort algorithm and
to examine different factors affecting the speed of sorting.

The record consisted of lengths of pentagon's sides and sorting was done by it's perimeter.
Sorting had to be done on disk tapes represented by disk files.
